# odin-recipes
First TOP project
In this project I built a very basic recipe website with a total of 4 webpages.
I added images to each recipe using the img tag, added some ordered and unordered lists and finally linked
every recipe page to index.html.
Edit : added some css in order to improver overall viewing experience
